    "1. **Align** the frames between behavioral data and neuron data by timestamp file\n",

    "* **gap_time**: In the raw video, there might be a gap time that the mouse is yet in the cage, so excludes this part helps the experimental veracity. Two ways to determine the gap time:\n",
    "    * CNMF-E folder may contain the gap information, such as 1056_SI_A_Substack (240-9603), means after 240 frames, the mouse then shows up in the cage\n",
    "    * Manually check the video one by one\n",
    "* **timestamp**: The file seperator is '\\t' and must exclude the first row (header) and rename them in [\"camNum\",\"frameNum\",\"sysClock\",\"buffer\"]\n",
    "* **video coordinates**: In the raw video, upper-left is (0,0), horizontal is X-axis, and vertical is Y-axis. While looking for the four corner points, screenshot one frame from the raw video, then import to image application, say photoshop/online RGB checker, to check its coordinates. (automation could be possible, but take time). Here are some corner points references for the experiment video:\n",

    "       * One free-moving mouse: 44 * 44\n",

    "    but it all depends on which scenario the experiment chose\n",
    "\n",
    "* **bullying mouse position**: \n",
    "    * For one free-moving scenario, the bullying mouse is fixed inside the enclosure, its position is therefore fixed as well. In such case, we will use the central point of the enclosure as the bullying mouse position \n",
    "    * For two free-moving scenario, the bulling mouse position is read from DeepLabCut behaviral data. Therefore the distance calculation would be different\n",
